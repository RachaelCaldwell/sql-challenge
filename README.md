# sql-challenge
The Module 9 Challenge is based on Pewlett Hackard employment data during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.<br> 

The challenge is divided into three parts: 
* data modeling
* data engineering
* data analysis

**Part One: Data Modeling**<br>
*Entity Relationship Diagram* showcasing all provided table schemas<br>
